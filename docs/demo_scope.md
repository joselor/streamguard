✅ **Stream processing** (C++ with Kafka)  
✅ **Storage** (RocksDB time-series)  
🚧 **AI threat analysis** (LLM-powered)  
🚧 **Threat intelligence** (RAG with vector DB)  
🚧 **Query API** (REST with Spring Boot)  
🚧 **Monitoring** (Prometheus + Grafana)  
🚧 **Cloud deployment** (AWS - optional)

### Technologies Demonstrated

## What's OUT OF SCOPE

### Performance Optimization
❌ **Multi-threading** - Not needed for demo  
❌ **50K events/sec target** - Current performance (100-200 e/s) is fine  
❌ **Binary serialization** - JSON is readable for demo  
❌ **Load testing** - Not required

### Advanced Features
❌ **ML model training** - Too complex for timeline  
❌ **ONNX integration** - Unnecessary complexity  
❌ **Advanced error handling** - Basic is sufficient  
❌ **Kubernetes deployment** - Docker Compose is adequate

### Production Concerns
❌ **High availability** - Single node is fine  
❌ **Data backup/recovery** - Not needed  
❌ **Security hardening** - Basic security is enough  
❌ **Extensive testing** - Core tests are sufficient

**Why Out of Scope:** These don't add interview value and would consume time better spent on AI features and demo polish.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| OpenAI API issues | Cache responses, use fallback statistical detection |
| Time overrun | Prioritize must-haves, skip nice-to-haves |
| Integration problems | Test incrementally, keep main branch stable |
| AWS costs | Monitor daily, use free tier, plan teardown |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Day job interruptions | Front-load critical work, work ahead on weekends |
| Learning curve (AI APIs) | Start simple, iterate, use examples |
| Demo video quality | Script thoroughly, practice, re-record if needed |

## Interview Talking Points

### On Technology Stack
> "I built StreamGuard using your exact tech stack. The C++ stream processor 
> handles high-throughput event processing with RocksDB for low-latency storage. 
> I chose Java for the generator and API because of Kafka's mature Java client 
> and Spring Boot's rapid development. I added Prometheus and Grafana for 
> observability - all technologies from your job description."

### On AI Integration
> "I integrated cutting-edge AI not because it's trendy, but because modern 
> security requires it. The LLM generates natural language threat explanations 
> that reduce analyst time-to-triage. The RAG system queries our threat 
> intelligence database to contextualize events - similar to how experienced 
> analysts think. This is where security is heading."

### On Architecture Decisions
> "Every decision was pragmatic: embedded RocksDB for zero network latency, 
> composite keys for efficient time-series queries, polyglot architecture 
> optimizing for both performance and development velocity. I documented all 
> trade-offs - that's the leadership thinking needed when guiding teams."

### On Timeline
> "I built this in 2 weeks while working full-time, showing I can move fast 
> while maintaining quality. The demo focuses on breadth - touching your entire 
> stack - rather than production optimization. That's the right prioritization 
> for demonstrating readiness."
